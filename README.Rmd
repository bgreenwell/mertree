`mertree` (mixed-effects regression trees) is an alternative implementation of [`REEMtree`](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jsimonof/REEMtree/) and [`REEMctree`](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jsimonof/unbiasedREEM/) that uses [`lme4`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) for efficient computation of mixed-effects models with large data sets.

## Installation

Package `mertree` is not currently available from CRAN, but the development version is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bgreenwell/mertree and can be downloaded using [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):
```r
# Assuming devtools is already installed
devtools::install_github("bgreenwell/mertree")
```
Bug reports should be submitted to https://github.com/bgreenwell/mertree/issues.

## Basic usage

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Required packages
library(lattice)  # for wireframe function
library(mertree)

# Fit a mertree
fm <- mertree(y ~ time + x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + (1 | subject),
              data = simd,
              unbiased = TRUE,
              do.trace = TRUE)

# Partial dependence on time
partial_1d(fm, x.name = "time", newdata = simd, .progress = "tk") %>%
  plot(type = "l")

# Partial dependence on covariates (notice x3 and x6 are flat!)
par(mfrow = c(3, 2))
for (i in 1:6) {
  partial_1d(fm, x.name = paste0("x", i), newdata = simd, .progress = "tk") %>%
    plot(type = "l")
}

# Interaction between x1 and x4
pd_14 <- partial_2d(fm, x1.name = "x1", x2.name = "x4", newdata = simd, 
                    .progress = "tk",
                    n1 = 20, n2 = 20)
wireframe(y ~ x1 * x4, data = pd_14, drape = TRUE, colorkey = TRUE)
```
